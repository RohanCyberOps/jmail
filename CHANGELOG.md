# JMail Changelog

## 1.6.3

- Fix bug where email addresses containing control characters in the local-part were incorrectly considered valid. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for reporting!)
- Add new methods `ifValid(Consumer<Email> action)` and `ifValidOrElse(Consumer<Email> action, Consumer<FailureReason> failureAction)` to the `EmailValidationResult` object.

---
## 1.6.2

- Fix bug where IPv4 addresses with non-arabic numerals would incorrectly be considered valid. (Thanks @harrel56 for reporting!)
- Fix bug where IPv4 addresses with extraneous leading zeros would incorrectly be considered valid. (Thanks @harrel56 for reporting!)
- The `requireValidMXRecord()` validation rule now correctly fails validation for domains that use a "Null MX" record. (Thanks @elmolm for contributing! ðŸŽ‰)

---
## 1.6.1

- Fix bug so that email addresses that end in a dash `-` character now correctly fail validation with the reason `FailureReason.DOMAIN_PART_ENDS_WITH_DASH` instead of incorrectly returning `FailureReason.ENDS_WITH_DOT`. (Thanks @tbatchlear for reporting!)

---
## 1.6.0

- Add a new rule `requireAscii()` that considers an email address containing non-ASCII characters to be invalid. (Thanks @frodeto for suggesting!)
- Add new property `isAscii()` on `Email` objects that returns if the email address only contains ASCII characters or not.
- Add option to strip quotes within the local-part of an email address when normalizing the address with the `normalize()` method. (Thanks @tdelaney-leadiro for suggesting!)
    - This new option will remove quotes if the email address would still be valid and semantically the same without them.
    - To enable the option, either:
        - Call the normalize method that takes a boolean as the parameter, and use `true`. Example: `email.normalize(true)`
        - Set the `-Djmail.normalize.strip.quotes=true` JVM property at runtime, and continue to use the `normalize()` method without parameters.

---
## 1.5.1

- Add a new rule `requireValidMXRecord(int initialTimeout, int numRetries)` that allows for customization of the timeout for DNS lookups. (Thanks @dotneutron for suggesting!)
- Reduce the default timeout for DNS lookups when adding the `requireValidMXRecord()` rule to an `EmailValidator` from potentially taking a maximum of 25 seconds to a maximum of 600 milliseconds.

---
## 1.5.0

- Add new method `validate(String email)` that returns an `EmailValidationResult` object, containing the reason for validation failure upon failure. (Thanks @bobharner for suggesting!)
- Add new `ValidationRule` `requireValidMXRecord()` to consider email addresses that have a domain with no MX record in DNS as invalid. (Thanks @lpellegr for suggesting!)
- Fix bug where an email address that ends with a comment that is missing the closing parentheses were incorrectly considered as valid. For example: `test@test.com(comment`

---
## 1.4.1

- Add new `ValidationRule` `disallowObsoleteWhitespace()` to consider email addresses with obsolete whitespace as invalid. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for suggesting!)

---
## 1.4.0

- Add new `normalized()` method on the `Email` class to provide a way to get a "normalized" version of an email address (the address without any comments or optional parts).

---
## 1.3.3

- Fix bug where invalid characters in the domain could result in an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of returning false. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for reporting!)

---
## 1.3.2

- Fix bug where domain names that contained an emoji would be incorrectly invalid. (Thanks @Autom8edChaos for reporting!)

---
## 1.3.1

- Improve `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for `Email` and `TopLevelDomain`
- Fix inconsistencies in some Javadocs

---
## 1.3.0

- `InternetProtocolAddress.validate(String ip)` now validates IPv6 addresses without requiring the `IPv6:` prefix.
- Add new `JMail.isInvalid(String email)` and `EmailValidator#isInvalid(String email)` methods as a convenience for testing if an email address is invalid.

---
## 1.2.3

- Add `toString()` method on `EmailValidator`
- Add `withRules(Collection<Predicate<Email>> rules)` method on `EmailValidator` to create a new `EmailValidator` from the collection of rules provided

---
## 1.2.2

- Fix bug where an exception would be thrown on invalid email addresses with whitespace or comments after a trailing `.` character. For example, `abc.def@ghi. (comment)` is invalid, and before this version JMail would throw an exception instead of return invalid.
  (Thanks @ea234 for reporting!)

---
## 1.2.1

- `EmailValidator` is now immutable

---
## 1.2.0

- Switch `TopLevelDomain` from an enum to a class, allowing for creation of any valid top level domain (Thanks @bowbahdoe!)
- Add `module-info.java` so projects on JDK 9+ can use this library as a Java module
- Bugfix: Addresses with empty quoted strings (`""@test.org`) are now correctly considered valid
- Bugfix: Addresses with explicit source routing (`@1st.relay,@2nd.relay:user@final.domain`) are now considered valid. However, explicit source routing is deprecated since RFC 5321. `JMail.strictValidator()` disallows explicit source routing by default
- Bugfix: Addresses with quoted identifiers (`John Smith <John@smith.com>`) are now correctly considered valid
- New properties on the `Email` object:
    - `identifier()`
    - `hasIdentifier()`
    - `explicitSourceRoutes()`

---
## 1.1.0

- Disallow construction of utility classes and prevent classes from being subclassed (Thanks @bowbahdoe!)
- Fix bug where email addresses that have a dotless domain or top level domain starting with the `-` character would be incorrectly classified as valid.
  For example, `test@-foo` and `test@my.-domain` should both be invalid.

---
## 1.0.4

- You can now disallow email addresses with reserved domains listed in [RFC 2606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606), such as `example.com` or `.invalid`.

   ```
   JMail.validator().disallowReservedDomains().isValid("test@example.com");
   ```
  
---
## 1.0.3

- Fix bug where JMail did not consider single quoted symbols (ex. `\@`) as valid.

---
## 1.0.2

- Better javadocs
- Internal performance improvements

---
## 1.0.1

- Add `JMail.strictValidator()` that has pre-configured common rules enabled (stricter than the RFCs allow)

---
## 1.0.0

- Initial release of JMail with email validation, IP address validation, and custom rules.
