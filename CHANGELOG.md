# JMail Changelog

## 2.0.0 (Upcoming)

### Email Address Normalization Improvements

#### Breaking changes

None, yet.

#### New Normalization Methods

This version introduces a new `NormalizationOptions` class that is used to provide
configuration of the behavior of the `Email#normalize()` method. See the table below to see
all the new and existing options.

In v2.0, you can use either `Email#normalize()` (with no parameters) or `Email#normalize(NormalizationOptions options)`.

The first method without parameters will return a normalized email address based on the default
normalization options. These defaults can also be changed for your application by setting the relevant system properties.

The second method allows you to provide your own `NormalizationOptions` at runtime depending on your needs.
The custom normalization options can be created using the `NormalizationOptions#builder()` method.

#### Normalization Options

Thanks, @Sprokof, for contributing (introducing removeDots and adjustCase options)! ðŸŽ‰

| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                | NormalizationOptions Builder Method                      | JVM System Property to Adjust Default |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| stripQuotes | Remove all unnecessary quotes in the local-part of the address                                                                             | `NormalizationOptions.builder().stripQuotes()`           | `jmail.normalize.strip.quotes=true`   |
| adjustCase  | Adjust the case of the email address. Possible options are: `NO_CHANGE`, `LOWERCASE`, `LOWERCASE_LOCAL_PART_ONLY`, `LOWERCASE_DOMAIN_ONLY` | `NormalizationOptions.builder().stripQuotes(CaseOption)` | `jmail.normalize.case=LOWERCASE`      |
| removeDots  | Remove all dots from the local-part of the address                                                                                         | `NormalizationOptions.builder().removeDots()`            | `jmail.normalize.remove.dots=true`    |

---
## 1.6.3

- Fix bug where email addresses containing control characters in the local-part were incorrectly considered valid. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for reporting!)
- Add new methods `ifValid(Consumer<Email> action)` and `ifValidOrElse(Consumer<Email> action, Consumer<FailureReason> failureAction)` to the `EmailValidationResult` object.

---
## 1.6.2

- Fix bug where IPv4 addresses with non-arabic numerals would incorrectly be considered valid. (Thanks @harrel56 for reporting!)
- Fix bug where IPv4 addresses with extraneous leading zeros would incorrectly be considered valid. (Thanks @harrel56 for reporting!)
- The `requireValidMXRecord()` validation rule now correctly fails validation for domains that use a "Null MX" record. (Thanks @elmolm for contributing! ðŸŽ‰)

---
## 1.6.1

- Fix bug so that email addresses that end in a dash `-` character now correctly fail validation with the reason `FailureReason.DOMAIN_PART_ENDS_WITH_DASH` instead of incorrectly returning `FailureReason.ENDS_WITH_DOT`. (Thanks @tbatchlear for reporting!)

---
## 1.6.0

- Add a new rule `requireAscii()` that considers an email address containing non-ASCII characters to be invalid. (Thanks @frodeto for suggesting!)
- Add new property `isAscii()` on `Email` objects that returns if the email address only contains ASCII characters or not.
- Add option to strip quotes within the local-part of an email address when normalizing the address with the `normalize()` method. (Thanks @tdelaney-leadiro for suggesting!)
    - This new option will remove quotes if the email address would still be valid and semantically the same without them.
    - To enable the option, either:
        - Call the normalize method that takes a boolean as the parameter, and use `true`. Example: `email.normalize(true)`
        - Set the `-Djmail.normalize.strip.quotes=true` JVM property at runtime, and continue to use the `normalize()` method without parameters.

---
## 1.5.1

- Add a new rule `requireValidMXRecord(int initialTimeout, int numRetries)` that allows for customization of the timeout for DNS lookups. (Thanks @dotneutron for suggesting!)
- Reduce the default timeout for DNS lookups when adding the `requireValidMXRecord()` rule to an `EmailValidator` from potentially taking a maximum of 25 seconds to a maximum of 600 milliseconds.

---
## 1.5.0

- Add new method `validate(String email)` that returns an `EmailValidationResult` object, containing the reason for validation failure upon failure. (Thanks @bobharner for suggesting!)
- Add new `ValidationRule` `requireValidMXRecord()` to consider email addresses that have a domain with no MX record in DNS as invalid. (Thanks @lpellegr for suggesting!)
- Fix bug where an email address that ends with a comment that is missing the closing parentheses were incorrectly considered as valid. For example: `test@test.com(comment`

---
## 1.4.1

- Add new `ValidationRule` `disallowObsoleteWhitespace()` to consider email addresses with obsolete whitespace as invalid. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for suggesting!)

---
## 1.4.0

- Add new `normalized()` method on the `Email` class to provide a way to get a "normalized" version of an email address (the address without any comments or optional parts).

---
## 1.3.3

- Fix bug where invalid characters in the domain could result in an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of returning false. (Thanks @PascalSchumacher for reporting!)

---
## 1.3.2

- Fix bug where domain names that contained an emoji would be incorrectly invalid. (Thanks @Autom8edChaos for reporting!)

---
## 1.3.1

- Improve `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for `Email` and `TopLevelDomain`
- Fix inconsistencies in some Javadocs

---
## 1.3.0

- `InternetProtocolAddress.validate(String ip)` now validates IPv6 addresses without requiring the `IPv6:` prefix.
- Add new `JMail.isInvalid(String email)` and `EmailValidator#isInvalid(String email)` methods as a convenience for testing if an email address is invalid.

---
## 1.2.3

- Add `toString()` method on `EmailValidator`
- Add `withRules(Collection<Predicate<Email>> rules)` method on `EmailValidator` to create a new `EmailValidator` from the collection of rules provided

---
## 1.2.2

- Fix bug where an exception would be thrown on invalid email addresses with whitespace or comments after a trailing `.` character. For example, `abc.def@ghi. (comment)` is invalid, and before this version JMail would throw an exception instead of return invalid.
  (Thanks @ea234 for reporting!)

---
## 1.2.1

- `EmailValidator` is now immutable

---
## 1.2.0

- Switch `TopLevelDomain` from an enum to a class, allowing for creation of any valid top level domain (Thanks @bowbahdoe!)
- Add `module-info.java` so projects on JDK 9+ can use this library as a Java module
- Bugfix: Addresses with empty quoted strings (`""@test.org`) are now correctly considered valid
- Bugfix: Addresses with explicit source routing (`@1st.relay,@2nd.relay:user@final.domain`) are now considered valid. However, explicit source routing is deprecated since RFC 5321. `JMail.strictValidator()` disallows explicit source routing by default
- Bugfix: Addresses with quoted identifiers (`John Smith <John@smith.com>`) are now correctly considered valid
- New properties on the `Email` object:
    - `identifier()`
    - `hasIdentifier()`
    - `explicitSourceRoutes()`

---
## 1.1.0

- Disallow construction of utility classes and prevent classes from being subclassed (Thanks @bowbahdoe!)
- Fix bug where email addresses that have a dotless domain or top level domain starting with the `-` character would be incorrectly classified as valid.
  For example, `test@-foo` and `test@my.-domain` should both be invalid.

---
## 1.0.4

- You can now disallow email addresses with reserved domains listed in [RFC 2606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606), such as `example.com` or `.invalid`.

   ```
   JMail.validator().disallowReservedDomains().isValid("test@example.com");
   ```
  
---
## 1.0.3

- Fix bug where JMail did not consider single quoted symbols (ex. `\@`) as valid.

---
## 1.0.2

- Better javadocs
- Internal performance improvements

---
## 1.0.1

- Add `JMail.strictValidator()` that has pre-configured common rules enabled (stricter than the RFCs allow)

---
## 1.0.0

- Initial release of JMail with email validation, IP address validation, and custom rules.
